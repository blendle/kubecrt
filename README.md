# kubecrt

Convert Helm charts to Kubernetes resources.

## Description

kubecrt allows you to define your application's Kubernetes infrastructure based
on a single configuration file.

The configuration file contains your application name, and namespace (both can
also be set using CLI arguments), and you provide a list of charts that you want
to install, optionally providing override values for those charts.

When running `kubecrt`, you provide it your project's configuration file, and in
turn, it returns you the parsed Kubernetes resource files generated by the
charts.

This allows you to use Helm Charts without actually using Helm, and instead
using regular `kubectl` to deploy and manage your resources.

The configuration file you feed into kubecrt will be processed using the epp
templating tool, allowing you to inject variables at runtime, based on your own
conditional logic (production vs staging, etc...).

## Installation

```
brew tap blendle/blendle
brew install kubecrt
```

## Usage

See `kubecrt --help`

```
kubecrt - convert Helm charts to Kubernetes resources

Given a charts.yml file, compile all the charts with
the provided template variables and return the
resulting Kubernetes resource files to STDOUT, or
write them to a provided file.

Doing this, you can use Kubernetes charts, without
having to use Helm locally, or Tiller on the server.

Usage:
  kubecrt [options] CHARTS_CONFIG
  kubecrt -h | --help
  kubecrt --version
  kubecrt --example-config

Where CHARTS_CONFIG is the location of the YAML file
containing the Kubernetes Charts configuration.

Arguments:
  CHARTS_CONFIG                    Charts configuration file

Options:
  -h, --help                       Show this screen
  --version                        Show version
  -n NS, --namespace=NS            Set the .Release.Namespace chart variable,
                                   used by charts during compilation
  -a NAME, --name=NAME             Set the .Release.Name chart variable, used by
                                   charts during compilation
  -o PATH, --output=PATH           Write output to a file, instead of STDOUT
  -r NAME=URL, --repo=NAME=URL,... List of NAME=URL pairs of repositories to add
                                   to the index before compiling charts config
  --example-config                 Print an example charts.yaml, including
                                   extended documentation on the tunables
```

## Charts Configuration File

See `kubecrt --example-config`

```yaml
# apiVersion defines the version of the charts.yaml structure. Currently,
# only "v1" is supported.
apiVersion: v1

# name is the .Release.Name template value that charts can use in their
# templates, which can be overridden by the "--name" CLI flag. If omitted,
# "--name" is required.
name: my-bundled-apps

# namespace is the .Release.Namespace template value that charts can use in
# their templates. Note that since kubecrt does not communicate with
# Kubernetes in any way, it is up to you to also use this namespace when
# doing kubectl apply [...]. Can be overridden using "--namespace".  If omitted,
# "--namespace" is required.
namespace: apps

# charts is an array of charts you want to compile into Kubernetes resource
# files.
#
# A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod,
# or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases,
# caches, and so on.
charts:

# A Chart can either be in the format REPO/NAME, or a PATH to a local chart.
#
# If using REPO/NAME, kubecrt knows by-default where to locate the "stable"
# repository, all other repositories require the "repo" configuration (see
# below).
- stable/factorio:
    # values is a map of key/value pairs used when compiling the chart. This
    # uses the same format as in regular chart "values.yaml" files.
    #
    # see: https://git.io/v9Tyr
    values:
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 1024Mi
          cpu: 750m
      factorioServer:
        # charts.yaml supports the same templating as chart templates do,
        # using the "sprig" library.
        #
        # see: https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/
        name: >
          {{ env "MY_SERVER_NAME" | default "hello world!" }}

- stable/minecraft:
    # version is a semantic version constraint.
    #
    # see: https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#basic-comparisons
    version: ~> 0.1.0
    values:
      minecraftServer:
        difficulty: hard

- opsgoodness/prometheus-operator:
    # repo is the location of a repositry, if other than "stable". This is
    # the URL you would normally add using "helm repo add NAME URL".
    repo: http://charts.opsgoodness.com
    values:
      sendAnalytics: false

# For the above charts, see here for the default configurations:
#
#   * stable/factorio: https://git.io/v9Tyr
#   * stable/minecraft: https://git.io/v9Tya
#   * opsgoodness/prometheus-operator: https://git.io/v9SAY
